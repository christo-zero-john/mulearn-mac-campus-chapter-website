      <p className="description">
        Mulearn works inside discord. Discord is a platform used by numerous
        communities (especially gaming communities) to hang out and coordinate.
        Every community in discord is called a
        <span className="mark">server</span>. Mulearn also has a discord server
        of its own. mulearn uses <span className="mark">gamification</span> as a
        tool that makes learning fun and engaging. Students gets{" "}
        <span className="mark"> Karma Points</span> (Points in mulearn are
        called as karma points . Just like experience points/exp in games.) for
        completing tasks or making certain accomplishments. Karma points are a
        proof of the work students do because these are earned by cracking tasks
        designed by the best mentors out there. Karma points are worth their
        weight in gold and can be used to obtain a variety of benefits,
        including invitations to exclusive and paid events, promotions in our
        community etc... There are certain internships that students having
        karma points above a certain limit could only apply for.
