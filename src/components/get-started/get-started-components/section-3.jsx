        mulearn also has a well defined{" "}
        <span className="mark">level system</span>. Every member in mulearn has
        their own level. When you join the discord server your will be{" "}
        <strong className="">level 1</strong>. To become a level 2 member you
        must introduce yourself to the community (You can find this as a task in
        lvl-1-info channel.). There are several{" "}
        <span className="mark">modertors</span> who reviews your task and gives
        you karma points. Once you get karma points for self-introduction, you
        will advance to <strong className="">Level 2</strong>. To become a level
        3 member you need to get atleast 400 karma points from level 2 tasks.
        All Tasks in lvl-2-info channel are level 2 tasks. Once you get 400
        karma points from level 2 tasks, you'll advance to{" "}
        <strong className="">Level 3</strong>
        To become a level 4 member you need to get atleast 800 karma points from
        level 3 tasks. All Tasks in lvl-3-info channel are level 3 tasks. Once
        you get 800 karma points from level 3 tasks, you'll advance to{" "}
        <strong className="">Level 4</strong>. The interesting fact is that{" "}
        <strong className="">
          There is no need for you to do tasks in any order. You can choose any
          task from any channel in a random order, and then complete and submit
          it to get corresponding karma points.
        </strong>{" "}
        That is you can do level 3 tasks even before becoming a level 3 member
        (That is wehn you are lvl 1 or lvl 2 member) and also you can do level 2
        tasks even after becoming a level 3 member and can do level 3 tasks even
        after becoming a level 4 member.

      <p className="description">
        Level 4 is an important <span className="mark">checkpoint</span>,
        because once you become a level 4 member, you gets access to{" "}
