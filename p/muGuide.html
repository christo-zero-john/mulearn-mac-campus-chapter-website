                <p class="description">
                    The First thing to do after joining the discord server is to <span class="mark"> introduce yourself to the community </span> (refer to <a href="/p/joinus.html#step5" class="text-decoration-none">step 5 </a> of join us page). After that familiarise yourself with our discord server enviornment.

                <p class="description">
                    Mulearn works inside discord. Discord is a platform used by numerous communities (especially
                    gaming communities) to hang out and coordinate. Every community in discord is called a
                    <span class="mark">server</span>.
                    Mulearn also has a discord server of its own. mulearn uses <span class="mark">gamification</span> as a tool that makes learning fun and engaging. Students gets <span class="mark"> Karma Points</span> (Points in mulearn are called as karma points . Just like experience points/exp in games.) for completing tasks or making certain accomplishments. Karma points are a proof of the work students do because these are earned by cracking tasks designed by the best  mentors out there. Karma points are worth their weight in gold and can be used to obtain a variety of benefits, including invitations to exclusive and paid events, promotions in our   community etc... There are certain internships that students having karma points above a certain limit could only apply for.

                    <p class="description">
                        Students engage in the community mainly by doing tasks. <strong class="">Every task has certain karma points assosciated with it.</strong> Just after you join the community you get access to 3 channels, which are: <code>lvl-1-info</code>, <code>lvl-2-info</code> & <code>lvl-3-info</code>. These channels conatins certain tasks ehich are related to certain general skills that everyone should have. Hence these tasks are called <span class="mark">General Enablement Tasks</span>. Every tasks has a unique <span class="mark">hashtag</span> (a code word that starts with #)assosciated with it. The hashtags of General Enablement Tasks starts with <span class="fw-700">#ge-</span>.

                    <p class="description">
                        mulearn also has a well defined <span class="mark">level system</span>. Every member in mulearn has their own level. When you join the discord server your will be <strong class="">level 1</strong>. To become a level 2 member you must introduce yourself to the community (You can find this as a task in lvl-1-info channel.). There are several <span class="mark">modertors</span> who reviews your task and gives you karma points. Once you get karma points for self-introduction, you will advance to <strong class="">Level 2</strong>. To become a level 3 member you need to get atleast 400 karma points from level 2 tasks. All Tasks in lvl-2-info channel are level 2 tasks. Once you get 400 karma points from level 2 tasks, you'll advance to <strong class="">Level 3</strong>

                        To become a level 4 member you need to get atleast 800 karma points from level 3 tasks. All Tasks in lvl-3-info channel are level 3 tasks. Once you get 800 karma points from level 3 tasks, you'll advance to <strong class="">Level 4</strong>. The interesting fact is that <strong class="">There is no need for you to do tasks in any order. You can choose any task from any channel in a random order, and then complete and submit it to get corresponding karma points.</strong> That is you can do level 3 tasks even before becoming a level 3 member (That is wehn you are lvl 1 or lvl 2 member) and also you can do level 2 tasks even after becoming a level 3 member and can do level 3 tasks even after becoming a level 4 member.

                        What exactly is an interest group? An interest group simply is a group related to certain career field like web development, cyber security, AI, IoT, etc... Students interested in these fields can choose these Interest groups and gets trained in that respective field. Currently in mulearn we have more than 11 Interest Groups. (You can see it all <a href="https://mulearn.org/journey" class="text-decoration-none">here</a> ). <strong class="">Only Level 4 members can Join Interest Groups.</strong>
